# pypkpd  
**pypkpd** is a computing package inspired by PopED project. Achieving the same purpose, pypkpd helps to compute optimal experimental designs for both population and individual studies based on nonlinear mixed-effect models.   

The original version called PopED is basically developed by R language and has contributed appreciably to the analysis of scholars studying population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Considering the popularity of Python, we hope to realize similar functions in Python.

## Innovation  
We created a new class "Matrix" based on numpy array. This makes elements of matrices can be named, searched and calculated without importing a pandas dataframe.
  
## Note  
This program is still under development!
